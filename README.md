## Installation 
To install all dependencies simply run `npm install` in the root folder of the project after cloning the repository.

## Usage 
- after you have installed all dependencies at the root folder you can set up MySQL
- enter `mysql -u (username) -p` and then enter your password
- to ensure that your MySQL password is not pushed to github, make sure you have a .env file that stores your databse name, username and password.
- Exit the MySQL shell and then seed the source files by entering `node seeds/index.js` 
- If your source files properly seed then you are ready to start the application by entering `npm start`. 
- Once the app is up and running you can test the backend routes for CRUD with whatever API platform you prefer to use.
